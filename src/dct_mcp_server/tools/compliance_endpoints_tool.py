    How to use filter_expresssion: 
    A request body containing a filter expression. This enables searching
    for items matching arbitrarily complex conditions. The list of
    attributes which can be used in filter expressions is available
    in the x-filterable vendor extension.
    
    # Filter Expression Overview
    **Note: All keywords are case-insensitive**
    
    ## Comparison Operators
    | Operator | Description | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | CONTAINS | Substring or membership testing for string and list attributes respectively. | field3 CONTAINS 'foobar', field4 CONTAINS TRUE  |
    | IN | Tests if field is a member of a list literal. List can contain a maximum of 100 values | field2 IN ['Goku', 'Vegeta'] |
    | GE | Tests if a field is greater than or equal to a literal value | field1 GE 1.2e-2 |
    | GT | Tests if a field is greater than a literal value | field1 GT 1.2e-2 |
    | LE | Tests if a field is less than or equal to a literal value | field1 LE 9000 |
    | LT | Tests if a field is less than a literal value | field1 LT 9.02 |
    | NE | Tests if a field is not equal to a literal value | field1 NE 42 |
    | EQ | Tests if a field is equal to a literal value | field1 EQ 42 |
    
    ## Search Operator
    The SEARCH operator filters for items which have any filterable
    attribute that contains the input string as a substring, comparison
    is done case-insensitively. This is not restricted to attributes with
    string values. Specifically `SEARCH '12'` would match an item with an
    attribute with an integer value of `123`.
    
    ## Logical Operators
    Ordered by precedence.
    | Operator | Description | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | NOT | Logical NOT (Right associative) | NOT field1 LE 9000 |
    | AND | Logical AND (Left Associative) | field1 GT 9000 AND field2 EQ 'Goku' |
    | OR | Logical OR (Left Associative) | field1 GT 9000 OR field2 EQ 'Goku' |
    
    ## Grouping
    Parenthesis `()` can be used to override operator precedence.
    
    For example:
    NOT (field1 LT 1234 AND field2 CONTAINS 'foo')
    
    ## Literal Values
    | Literal      | Description | Examples |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Nil | Represents the absence of a value | nil, Nil, nIl, NIL |
    | Boolean | true/false boolean | true, false, True, False, TRUE, FALSE |
    | Number | Signed integer and floating point numbers. Also supports scientific notation. | 0, 1, -1, 1.2, 0.35, 1.2e-2, -1.2e+2 |
    | String | Single or double quoted | "foo", "bar", "foo bar", 'foo', 'bar', 'foo bar' |
    | Datetime | Formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) | 2018-04-27T18:39:26.397237+00:00 |
    | List | Comma-separated literals wrapped in square brackets | [0], [0, 1], ['foo', "bar"] |
    
    ## Limitations
    - A maximum of 8 unique identifiers may be used inside a filter expression.
